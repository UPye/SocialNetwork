## Overview
REST API using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express.js, and Moment. This API can be used as a basis for any program. 

## Installation
You will need to install express, mongoose, mongodb, moment and node (if not already downloaded). Install these packages to run and contribute to this app.

## Future Developments
I would love to expand on this rest API into a full site, rather it be e-commerce or a full social media site.

## Credits
I want to thank UCF coding bootcamp, YouTube University, and Google University for the knowledge gained this week to construct this website.
